<p>Around the end of August my family and I went to Cancun, Mexico. It was an amazing trip and my first time out of the country. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel for seven days. We got to go snorkeling, golfing, sight seeing and just hang around the resort with a pool, hot tubs, casinos and of course the beach.</p>
